# Amicale Vagrant

Amicale Vagrant is a side project to store a vagrant machine to help developers 
to work on [Amicale](https://github.com/yoannfleurydev/amicale-src) project. 

To see the configuration of this Vagrant machine, just take a look at the 
[config.yml](https://github.com/yoannfleurydev/amicale-vagrant/blob/master/puphpet/config.yaml) 
file.

1. Clone this repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yoannfleurydev/amicale-vagrant.git

to up the machine.
